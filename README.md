# 👋 Hi, I’m Nghia Nguyen (tronghiant)

I'm a front-end engineer currently working at a Japanese software company, based in Vietnam.  
I care deeply about **code clarity**, **developer experience**, and building tools that reduce complexity and improve productivity.

---

## 🧠 What I’m Good At

- Writing **high-quality, strongly-typed** frontend code
- Investigating how things work — from **AST-level transformations** to **system processes**
- Debugging tricky issues across the stack: frontend ↔ dev environment ↔ infrastructure
- Improving codebases by simplifying logic and eliminating fragile patterns
- Communicating across languages: **English**, **Japanese**, **Vietnamese**

## 📌 Strengths & Work Style

- 🔍 Detail-oriented and curious — I go beyond surface-level problems to understand underlying behavior
- 🛠️ Efficient — I customize my tools and environment to boost productivity (e.g., Multipass VM, XFCE4 + noVNC)
- 🌏 Multilingual and culturally adaptive — experience collaborating with international teams
- 🤝 Team-aware — care about how code and feedback affect people, not just systems

---

## 🔧 Current Focus

- Building better **DX tools** for frontend engineers
- Improving **internal tooling**, AST manipulation, and compiler-level understanding
- Learning more about **observability**, performance monitoring, and production diagnostics
